## Usage
When the user opens the app, they are given a command line prompt.
The user is then prompted to answer these questions:
- Team manager's name
- Team manager's employee ID
- Team manager's email address
- Team manager's office number

Next, the user is prompted to add an Engineer or an Intern.
If Engineer is selected, the user is asked these questions:
- Engineer's name
- Engineer's employee ID
- Engineer's email address
- Engineer's Github account
If Intern is selected, the user is asked these questions:
- Intern's name
- Intern's employee ID
- Intern's email address
- Intern's school

Then the user is asked if they would like to add any more employees.
If so, the prompts repeat. If not, an HTML page index.html is created.

When any employee's email address is clicked, the default email program opens.
When the Engineer's Github is clicked, a new tab opens up.
